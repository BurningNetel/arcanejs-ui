# Reload
Reload is a JS framework that allows for complex webapplications to be built in a pure ES6 object oriented fashion.

#What about HTML?
HTML was first released in 1993 and it's intended was is to define STATIC web content. It was in no shape or form conveived with the development of fully featured webapplications in mind. Trying to use HTML to develop complex webapplications is like using a hammer to screw in a lightbulb. Many frameworks however, try to facilitate this by using templates and directives. Entire languages have even been developed for this purpose. But HTML will never be more than a poor XML implementation. And like the data interchange format it was based on, has no place in modern webdevelopment.

If you like XML or like using the wrong tool for the job, this library is not for you.
